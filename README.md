# MauiAIUsageTest
This test is a about creating a simple .NET MAUI app with GitHub Copilot and then with Bing Copilot and getting some experience with both. 

Both apps are doing the same and should consists of the same classes. They are not finished! I just set myself a timelimit of one hour to create the first app with GitHub Copilot. Then I used Bing Copilot to check how long I need to get the app to the same state. I tried to use the AI only and no coding from my side, but sometimes I had to change some bits and bytes.
